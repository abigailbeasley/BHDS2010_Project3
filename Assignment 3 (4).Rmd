#Interpretation of the ggplot
#Beginning at the Baseline data, both groups show a similar distribution of text
#messages. The median values are close with Group 2 having a slightly higher
#median, but there is no obvious significant different in central tendency. The
#IQR is similar, suggesting similar spread amongst the central 50% of the data
#and there are no clear outliers for either group. Moving to the Six Months
#comparison, both groups show a decrease in the median number of text messages
#with Group 2 still have a larger median. The difference in medians has
#significantly increase compared to Baseline. In terms of spread, Group 1
#appears to have a larger IQR with the central 50% if the data being more spread
#out compared to Group 2. There are several outliers within Group 1 and only two
#outliers in Group 2. Based on these observations, it appears that at Baseline,
#both distributions are relatively symmetrical but become more variable over
#time with both distributions becoming left-skewed. However, the variability
#differs with Group 1 appearing to show the most variation over time.
