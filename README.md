## Description of analysis
In this project, we analyzed text data to generate two plots (a box plot and a bar chart) of text behavior across two
different groups at two different times. Further descriptive statistics were conducted on the text data including:

- median number of texts per group per time period
- mean number of texts per group per time period
- standard deviations for each group and time period
- min and max for each group and time period


The findings from the box plot indicate that the distribution of texts were mostly similar at
baseline, with a slighter smaller IQR in Group 2 and a slightly higher mean. At the six month mark, however, the distributions looked
very different, with a much more pronounced increase in the mean texts sent in group 2 compared to Group 1. Furthermore,
Group 1 was more left-skewed, whereas group 2 appears right skewed.

The findings in the bar chart indicate that, at baseline, both groups sent roughly the same number of texts. At the
second time point, however, there was a decrease in text messages from Group 2 and an even more pronounced decrease from Group 1.


## Instructions
To run analysis, open the Assignment-3 (4 file and knit the document to generate a report of text counts by group and time point.

To view report, simply look at the file titled Assignment-3.pdf.

### Dependencies:

Ensure the following packages are installed: tidyverse, pastecs, dplyr, ggplot2

Ensure that 'texts.csv' is stored within the current directory.
